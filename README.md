# Robot-s-eyes-circuit
In this project, eyes controller ciruit implimented with external 9v battery as an assumption, but in robot will be feed the circuit by its 12v power supply as I did in my previous circuit.
It got 3.3v converter to suit the LEDs.
( PARALLEL connection ) is for future upgrade such as: blinking eye for the robot emotions.
